Steps:


1. Clone the QEMU repo and build the docker image. Required only once or after
`realclean`.

make configure

2. Build QEMU.

make

3. Clean the build.

make clean

4. Trasnfer the rpm file on the host machine. Run

yum install --nogpgcheck -y qemu-upstream-1.0-1.el7.x86_64.rpm


Notes:

1. Once `make configure` is run, you can find the QEMU source code in
`rpmbuild/SOURCES/qemu`.

2. To clean the qemu source code and docker build alongwith make build:

make realclean

3. After `make realclean`, you need to run `make configure` again before `make`.

4. To uninstall the build on the node:

yum remove -y qemu-upstream-1.0-1.el7.x86_64

5. You may need to install docker if not already installed on your dev VM.

yum install -y docker
